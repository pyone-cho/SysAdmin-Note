1. Show Journal file Usage
	journalctl --disk-usage

2. If you decide to clear the logs, run command to rotate the journal files. All currently active journal files will be marked as archived, so that they are never written to in future.
	sudo journalctl --rotate


3. Now clear the journal logs by choosing one of following commands:
#Delete journal logs older than X days:
	sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=2days
#Delete log files until the disk space taken falls below the specified size:
	sudo journalctl --vacuum-size=100M
#Delete old logs and limit file number to X:
	sudo journalctl --vacuum-files=5

4. You can also edit the configuration file to limit the journal log disk usage (100 MB for example).
	sudo -H gedit /etc/systemd/journald.conf

When the file opens, un-comment (remove # at the beginning) the line #SystemMaxUse= and change it to SystemMaxUse=100M.
	systemctl daemon-reload
