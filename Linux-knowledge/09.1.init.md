# `init` System

<p>The System V (SysV) init is a traditional Linux initialization system that manages system services and processes during boot and shutdown. It uses shell scripts located in /etc/init.d/ and symbolic links in runlevel directories (e.g., /etc/rc.d/ or /etc/rcX.d/).

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of SysV init concepts and common commands:</p>

### Key Concepts
#### 1.Runlevels:

- Runlevels define the state of the system and which services are active.
- Common runlevels:
    - 0: Halt the system.
    - 1: Single-user mode (rescue mode).
    - 2: Multi-user mode without network services (varies by distro).
    - 3: Multi-user mode with network (text-based).
    - 4: Undefined (user-defined or unused).
    - 5: Multi-user mode with a graphical interface.
    - 6: Reboot the system.
#### 2.Scripts:

<p> Scripts are located in /etc/init.d/.
Runlevel directories (e.g., /etc/rcX.d/) contain symlinks to these scripts with names like Sxx (start) and Kxx (kill), where xx determines the order of execution.</p>

### Change Runlevels:

```bash
init <runlevel>
```
Example: Switch to runlevel 3 (multi-user mode):

```bash
init 3
```
Check Current Runlevel:

```bash
runlevel
```
Output:

```bash
N 5
```
- N: No previous runlevel (e.g., on system boot).
- 5: Current runlevel.
