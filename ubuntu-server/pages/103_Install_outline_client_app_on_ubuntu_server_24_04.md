# Install outline client app on ubuntu server 24.04

Installing the Outline client application on an Ubuntu Server 24.04 isn't as straightforward as installing a desktop application with a GUI. Ubuntu Server is typically used without a graphical interface.

Here's how you can approach it, keeping in mind that the Outline client is primarily designed for end-user devices (desktops, phones) to connect to an Outline server:

##### Understanding Outline Components:

- Outline Manager: This is a desktop application (Windows, macOS, Linux GUI) used to create and manage your Outline VPN server. You typically install this on your personal computer, not the Ubuntu server.

- Outline Server: This is the VPN server software that runs on your Ubuntu Server. This is what provides the VPN service.

- Outline Client: This is the application you use on your device (laptop, phone, etc.) to connect to your Outline Server using an access key generated by the Manager.

##### Why you might want the client on a server (and why it's usually not recommended):

- Testing/Troubleshooting: You might want to test connectivity from the server itself.

- Server-to-Server VPN: If your Ubuntu server needs to connect to another Outline VPN server.

- Command-line access: If you need to manage the client purely from the command line.

### Methods to install Outline Client on Ubuntu Server 24.04 (command-line focused):

##### Method 1: Using Snap (Recommended for client on Linux)

Snaps are self-contained packages that work across different Linux distributions. Outline provides a snap package for its client.


- Ensure Snap is installed: Snap is usually pre-installed on Ubuntu 24.04. You can verify with:

```Bash
snap version
```
If it's not installed, you can install it:

```Bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install snapd
```
Install the Outline Client snap:
The Outline client is often in the "edge" channel (unstable/development) for Linux.

```Bash
sudo snap install outline-client --edge
```
    Note: As of recent information, the outline-client snap might be on the edge channel and could be unstable. There have been reports of it not launching correctly on Ubuntu 24.04.

- Launch the client (if possible) and add access key:
If the snap installs successfully, you might be able to launch it. However, since it's a server, you likely don't have a GUI. You would typically need to interact with it via command line.

    -   Unfortunately, the official Outline client snap primarily provides a GUI application. Running it on a headless server (no GUI) might not be practical or even possible for direct usage.

### Method 2: Using the Outline CLI (Command Line Interface) - A Better Fit for Servers

For server environments, a command-line client is often more suitable. There are community-maintained projects that provide a CLI for Outline. One popular one is kira-nt/outline-cli.

- Install dependencies:

```Bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git curl build-essential jq -y
```
- Clone the `outline-cli` repository:

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/Kira-NT/outline-cli.git
cd outline-cli
```
- Run the installation script:

```Bash
sudo ./install.sh -y
```
This script will build and install the Outline CLI, handle Go installation (if needed), and set up necessary components.

- Usage:
Once installed, you'll typically use the vpn command.

    - Add an access key: You'll need an access key (the ss:// string) generated from your Outline Manager.

```Bash
sudo vpn add "ss://YOUR_OUTLINE_ACCESS_KEY_HERE" "MyServerVPN"
```
Replace `"ss://YOUR_OUTLINE_ACCESS_KEY_HERE"` with your actual access key and `"MyServerVPN"` with a name for your connection.

- List saved access keys:

```Bash
sudo vpn list
```
- Connect to your Outline server:

```Bash
sudo vpn connect MyServerVPN
```
(Replace MyServerVPN with the name you assigned)

Disconnect:

```Bash
sudo vpn disconnect
```
### Important Considerations for Ubuntu Server:

- Firewall (UFW): If you have a firewall enabled on your Ubuntu server (e.g., UFW), you'll need to allow traffic for Outline.

    - The Outline server installation script often handles firewall rules for the server itself.

    - If you're using the client on the server to connect out, you generally don't need to open specific incoming ports for the client itself, but ensure your server can make outgoing connections (which it usually can by default).

- Headless Environment: Remember that Ubuntu Server usually runs without a graphical interface. If you install the snap package of Outline Client, it might expect a GUI and won't work as expected. The outline-cli project is explicitly designed for command-line usage.

- Purpose: Clearly define why you need the Outline client on your Ubuntu server. For most users, the Outline server runs on the Ubuntu machine, and clients connect from their local desktops/laptops/phones.

Choose the method that best suits your needs. For purely command-line interaction and server-to-server connectivity, the outline-cli is the more appropriate solution. If you somehow have a GUI on your Ubuntu server, then the Snap method might be relevant.
